## 📌 Project Description

**Foody by HopeConnect** is a location-based chat application designed to reduce food wastage and fight hunger. It connects **donors** who have excess food with **beneficiaries** in need. Donors can quickly report surplus food via the chat interface, and nearby beneficiaries are notified instantly.

The platform uses **location-based matchmaking** to efficiently pair users, ensuring quick collection and minimum food spoilage. It's a step toward building a compassionate and sustainable community.

### Notes:
- Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID from your Vimeo URL (e.g., if your link is `https://vimeo.com/123456789`, then use `123456789`).
- Embedding with `<iframe>` works on Markdown **preview-capable renderers** (like some docs platforms), but **GitHub ignores it**. So a plain link is also provided for fallback.

Would you like this saved as a `.md` file for easy upload?
