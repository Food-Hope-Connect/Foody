## 📌 Project Description

**Foody by HopeConnect** is a location-based chat application designed to reduce food wastage and fight hunger. It connects **donors** who have excess food with **beneficiaries** in need. Donors can quickly report surplus food via the chat interface, and nearby beneficiaries are notified instantly.

The platform uses **location-based matchmaking** to efficiently pair users, ensuring quick collection and minimum food spoilage. It's a step toward building a compassionate and sustainable community.
